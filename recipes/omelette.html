        <div class="subheading"><h3>Description</h3></div>
            The understated Omelette. A simple recipe of eggs and butter that can be complemented with
            just about any filling. Quite a technical recipe considering it's simplicity so you may
            need a bit of practice to get this one right. Persevere though, it's worth it!

        <div class="subheading"><h3>Ingredients</h3></div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3</strong> eggs (beaten)</li>
            <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> sunflower oil</li>
            <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> butter</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="subheading"><h3>Steps</h3></div>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Generously season the beaten eggs with salt and pepper.
                Heat the oil and butter in a frying pan over a medium-low heat
                until the butter has melted and is foaming.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Pour eggs into the pan, tilting the pan slightly from one
                side to the other, allowing the eggs to cover the surface of the pan.
                Allow the mixture to cook for around 20 seconds then scrape a line
                through the middle with a spatula.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Tilt the pan to allow the runny egg to cover the pan again.
                Repeat a couple more times until the egg has <em>just</em> set.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Now go <em>ham</em> on the fillings and scatter them over the top of the omelette
                and gently fold in half with the spatula. Slide onto a plate and serve.
            </li>
